## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and play a crucial role in various applications. This project aims to explore different sorting algorithms and analyze their performance using Big O notation. By understanding the efficiency of these algorithms, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm to choose based on the size and nature of the data.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

Each algorithm is thoroughly documented, and their time complexity is analyzed in terms of Big O notation.

## Implementation

The code is organized into a clean and modular structure to facilitate easy comprehension and modification. Each sorting algorithm has its dedicated source file with accompanying header files for necessary declarations.

The project also includes a common header file (`sort.h`) that defines common data structures and functions used across different sorting algorithms.

## Usage

To use the sorting algorithms implemented in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x1B-C-Sorting-Algorithms-Big-O.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x1B-C-Sorting-Algorithms-Big-O
   ```

3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc -o x-main *.c
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./x-main
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to test different sorting algorithms and view their performance.
